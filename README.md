This project is a Python script that fully automates the course registration process on the **SESS academic portal** for Shahrekord University. Using the Selenium library, the bot handles logging in, waiting for the registration window to open, and registering for a predefined list of courses automatically.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Login**: Securely logs into the SESS portal using your credentials.
- **Smart Retry Mechanism**: If the registration window isn't open, the bot intelligently retries every 10 seconds.
- **Batch Course Registration**: Reads a list of desired courses from a `.env` file and attempts to register them.
- **Subgroup Support**: Handles courses with and without subgroups (e.g., lab sections).
- **System Message Handling**: Intelligently processes system feedback messages, such as success, time conflicts, or credit limit errors.
- **Status Reporting**: Checks and reports the reasons why certain courses are unavailable for registration.
